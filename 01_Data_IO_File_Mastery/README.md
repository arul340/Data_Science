# 📂 01_Data_IO_File_Mastery

This folder contains all mini-projects and exercises focused on mastering **Data Input/Output (I/O)** operations in Python — one of the most essential foundations for any aspiring Data Scientist.

Each project demonstrates practical use of file handling, structured data manipulation, and integration with real-world data formats such as **CSV**, **JSON**, and **Excel**.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:

- Understand how to **read and write files** in Python (`open()`, `with`, file modes)
- Handle **CSV and TSV files** using both `csv.reader` and `csv.DictReader`
- Manage structured data formats like **JSON** and **Excel**
- Use **pathlib** for modern and reliable file path operations
- Implement **advanced file handling** (append, overwrite, and directory creation)
- Build **mini data pipelines** that simulate real-world automation
